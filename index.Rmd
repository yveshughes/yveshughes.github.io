# Aloha!
My name is Yves and I love building things that make a positive impact in people's lives.

I live in Texas but have lived in Hawaii, California, and Illinois.

My fist degree was a BFA in Web Design from the Illinois Institute of Art and my MBA was in Technology Management from the University of Phoenix.

During the day you'll catch me at Salesforce as Product Manager. In the evenings--- well.... I'm Batman.
